# Title of Project: BMI Calculator App

# Project Description:

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator App is a lightweight Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users calculate their BMI based on height and weight inputs. It provides instant feedback along with health categorization such as Underweight, Normal, and Overweight. The app is simple, responsive, and runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices. Optional web support can also be enabled using Flutter's web capabilities.

# Project's Goals:

* Provide an intuitive interface for calculating BMI.
* Offer instant BMI results with classification.
* Educate users on healthy weight ranges.

BMI Calculator Page 
It is a default screen when user opens up the app , the screen will display weight and height textfields to get the user input.

# Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter framework.
* Understanding of BMI and how it's calculated:
  **BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m)Â²)**
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
* An ios or android emulator or browser for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

# Technologies and Tools Utilized:
 
* Flutter: Framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* Dart: The programming language used with Flutter for app logic, state management, and UI.
* Flutter Widgets: For building responsive and customized UIs with a native look and feel.
* Android Studio / VS Code: IDEs used for Flutter development, testing, and debugging.
* Emulator or Physical Devices: For testing the app on Android, iOS, or other platforms.

# Key Deliverables:

* A fully functional Flutter mobile application that calculates BMI.
* Input fields for user data (height in ft, weight in kg). Seperate fields will be there for feets and inches. It will then converts feet to metres for calculation of BMI.
* A real-time BMI calculation and classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
* A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface built using Flutter widgets.
* Platform support for Android (and optionally iOS or web).

# Outcome:

A fully functional, cross-platform BMI Calculator mobile app.
Improved knowledge and hands-on experience with Flutter, Dart, and mobile UI/UX design.
A polished, portfolio-worthy application showcasing practical development skills.
A health-focused utility that helps users understand and track their body mass index.
